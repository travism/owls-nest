## Phase 1 — Foundation (MVP direct-booking engine)

**Goal:** Property can take direct bookings end-to-end.

### M1 — Monorepo skeleton
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] pnpm workspace root, `apps/*` and `packages/*` wired
- [x] `apps/api` (NestJS) boots with health endpoint
- [x] `apps/web` (Astro) renders placeholder homepage
- [x] `apps/admin` (Vite + React + React Router v6) renders shell
- [x] `apps/build-worker` builds; consumes BullMQ job stub
- [x] `packages/shared` exports a Zod schema both api + web import
- [x] `packages/prisma` — schema covers all V1 entities (incl. Outbox, WebhookEvent, AuditLogEntry, CleanerRequestToken, TaxJurisdiction, PricingCacheEntry)
- [x] `prisma migrate dev` runs cleanly against host Postgres
- [x] Seed script populates Property + 2 TaxJurisdictions + default MessageTemplates + AdminUser placeholder
- [x] Docker Compose runs Redis + api + web + admin + build-worker; `media` and `web-dist` volumes mounted per ARCHITECTURE.md §11.1
- [x] `.env.example` complete; api env validated by Zod at boot

**Acceptance:** `pnpm install && pnpm -r run build` succeeds for all four apps + both packages. API `node dist/main.js` boots and `curl http://localhost:3000/health` → 200 with `{"status":"ok","uptime":...}`. Web and admin produce static `dist/` output. Verified 2026-04-25.

All M1 acceptance criteria pass. Postgres `owlsnest` role + database created on host; migration applied; seed verified.

**Acceptance:** Admin can edit property, pricing, manual blocks; quote endpoint returns correct two-tax breakdown.

**Status:** ⬜ Not started

- [ ] Outbox emits confirmation SMS/email + `rebuild-site` job
- [ ] Conflict detection at approval time (calls `AvailabilityService`)
